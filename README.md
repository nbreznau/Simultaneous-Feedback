This Repository provides tehnical specs and code for my research investigating feedback between public opinion and social policy using [ISSP](http://www.issp.org/menu-top/home/) data. This repository provides the basic data work up and then specific analyses for the following published papers:

Breznau, Nate. 2017. “[Positive Returns and Equilibrium: Simultaneous Feedback Between Public Opinion and Social Policy](https://doi.org/10.1111/psj.12171).” _Policy Studies Journal_ 45(4):583–612.

Breznau, Nate. forthcoming. “[Simultaneous Feedback Models with Macro-Comparative Cross-Sectional Data](https://doi.org/10.12758/mda.2017.07).” _Methods, Data, Analyses_.


# Constructing the Datasets
## ISSP 
To build the macro-data used in the replication, users must get access to the ISSP data via GESIS/ZACAT. Then dowload the following data in Stata format and save to the path "C:/data/": 

__Role of Government__ 1985 ([ZA1490.dta](http://dx.doi.org/10.4232/1.1490)), 1990 ([ZA1950.dta](http://dx.doi.org/10.4232/1.1950)) and 1996 ([ZA2900.dta](http://dx.doi.org/10.4232/1.2900)).
